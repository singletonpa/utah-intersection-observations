## Utah research projects for pedestrian safety involving observations at intersections
This repository contains data and scripts associated with multiple research projects conducted by [Patrick Singleton](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/people/faculty/singleton-patrick) of the [Singleton Transportation Lab](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/research/labs/patrick-singleton/index) at Utah State University. These projects all involve observational data collection, taken from videos recorded at/near signalized intersections in Utah. Many projects were sponsored by the [Utah Department of Transportation](https://www.udot.utah.gov/connect/about-us/technology-innovation/research-innovation-division/). 
## Projects
* **[UDOT-20.312](UDOT-20.312)**: Right-turn safety for walking/bicycling: Impacts of curb/corner radii and other factors
* **[UDOT-20.313](UDOT-20.313)**: Pedestrian traffic signal violations: Safety, design, and operational implications
* **[UDOT-22.601 and MPC-693](UDOT-22.601)**: Pedestrian safety and traffic operations near transit stops
