## UT-23.09: Right-turn safety for walking/bicycling: Impacts of curb/corner radii and other factors
This repository contains data and scripts associated with the "Right-turn safety for walking/bicycling: Impacts of curb/corner radii and other factors" research project UDOT-20.312, funded by the Utah Department of Transportation, and carried out by [Patrick Singleton](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/people/faculty/singleton-patrick), [Michelle Mekker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-mekker-548804152/), [Alyssa Gaither](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssadgaither/), [Atul Subedi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atulsub/), [Ahadul Islam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahadulislam/), and the [Singleton Transportation Lab](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/research/labs/patrick-singleton/index) at Utah State University.
* **Objective**
    * To understand factors (especially curb/corner radii) affecting safety at intersections involving right-turning vehicles and pedestrians/bicyclists. 
* **Methods**
    * ***Crash analysis***: Data were assembled about more than 1,000 pedestrian and nearly 1,200 bicycle crashes with right-turning vehicles at signalized intersections in Utah from 2010 to 2019, and analyses involved comparisons using chi-square tests and multivariate zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. (Data for the crash analysis are not included here.)
    * ***Conflict analysis***: Data were transcribed from videos recorded at 34 signalized intersections in Utah in 2021 and 2022 capturing more than 1,500 pedestrian conflicts with right-turning vehicles, and analyses involved correlations as well as multilevel regression models.
