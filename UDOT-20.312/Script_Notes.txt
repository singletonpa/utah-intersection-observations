Notes about data processing, data analysis, and R scripts

1 Data Cleaning/Data Cleaning.R
-> Before running script, copy old files to archive
 • Takes raw survey data (CSVs) from “Data/Data from Videos/Checked” folder
 • Processes columns
 • Creates wide and long versions
 • Saves “datwide” and “datlong” (RDS, CSV) files in the main folder
-> Need to move these 4 files to “1 Data Cleaning”

2 Location Data Assembly/assemble location data.R
-> Before running script, copy old files to archive
 • Reads in “New_Videos.xlsx” file from “Data/Data from Videos” folder
   o This is a table of all videos that were recorded by PAS in 2021-22 school year
 • Reads in “Signal Corner Info_21.xlsx” file from “Data/Locations” folder
   o This is a table of the signal corner geometric information collected in Summer 2021
 • Reads in “intdata.rds” from “Data/Ints” folder
   o This is a table with average pedestrian volumes and built environment information at signals, collected for “UDOT-19.504 Traffic signal pedestrians II” project
 • Reads in “Signal Database_Trial.csv” from “Data/Locations” folder
   o This is a table with information about pedestrian crossings and approaches at signals, collected for the “UDOT-19.316 Ped safety signals” project
 • Selects relevant information from respective datasets
 • Merges datasets together
 • Saves result as “datlocation” (CSV, RDS) files in the main folder
-> Need to move these 2 files to “2 Location Data Assembly”

3 Combine All Data/combine all data.R
-> Before running script, copy old files to archive
 • Loads “datlocation.rds” file from “2 Location Data Assembly” folder
 • Reads in datwide and datlong files from “1 Data Cleaning” folder
 • Merges datasets together
 • Adds traffic signal status information
   o Reads in functions used to process signal data from “funs.R”
   o Reads in functions used to get signal status info from “signal_status_funs.R”
 • Adds weather information
   o Uses queries to IEMRE (https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/iemre/) to get mostly hourly temperature and precipitation. 
 • Saves results as “datwidecombo” and “datlongcombo” (RDS, CSV) in the main folder
-> Need to move these 4 files to “3 Combine All Data”

4 Bivariate Analysis/table_desc_corr.R
-> Before running script, copy old files to archive
 • Loads “datlongcombo.rds” file from “3 Combine All Data” folder
 • Filters for encroachment time <= 10 seconds and not missing
 • Runs “add_vars.R” script to calculate many relevant variables
   o This script calculates variables used for descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression
 • Selects level one and level two variables, and selects independent variables
 • Calculates descriptive statistics for level one and level two variables separately
 • Creates function to calculate and get correlation test results
 • Calculates correlations and correlation test results for each dependent variable
 • Saves results as “table_desc_” {L1,L2} (csv) in the main folder
 • Saves results as “table_corr_” {1,2,3,4,5,6} (csv) in the main folder
-> Need to move these 8 files to “4 Bivariate Analysis”

5 Multilevel Models/MLmodels.R
-> Before running script, copy old files to archive
 • Loads “datlongcombo.rds” file from “3 Combine All Data” folder
 • Filters for encroachment time <= 10 seconds and not missing
 • Runs “add_vars.R” script to calculate many relevant variables
   o This script calculates variables used for descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression
 • Selects independent variables
 • Calculates correlations
 • Saves results as “mycor_” {1,2} (csv) in this folder
 • Filters selected independent variables
 • Estimates multilevel regression models for each of the dependent variables
   o Estimates intercept-only and random intercept only models
   o Estimates models trying only one variable at a time
   o Estimates models with all significant variables, uses backwards elimination
   o Summarizes and combines models together
   o Saves data and models as “mods” {1,2,3,4,5,6} (rds) in the main folder
-> Need to move these 6 files to “5 Multilevel Models”
