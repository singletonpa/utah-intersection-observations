## Pedestrian traffic signal violations: Safety, design, and operational implications
This repository contains data and scripts associated with the "Pedestrian traffic signal violations: Safety, design, and operational implications" research project UDOT-20.313, funded by the Utah Department of Transportation, and carried out by [Patrick Singleton](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/people/faculty/singleton-patrick), [Michelle Mekker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-mekker-548804152/), Sadie Boyer, and the [Singleton Transportation Lab](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/research/labs/patrick-singleton/index) at Utah State University.
* **Objective**
    * To improve pedestrian safety at signalized intersections by focusing on pedestrian signal violations: measuring behaviors, associating characteristics and locations, and identifying potential mitigation strategies. 
* **Methods**
    * We recorded videos and collected and analyzed observational data on pedestrian crossing behaviors, specifically: 5,589 pedestrian crossing events for 47 crosswalks at 39 signalized intersections in Utah.
    * After linking these data with information about the location and traffic signal status, we performed descriptive and statistical analyses of the assembled data to identify people, conditions, and locations with greater and lesser rates of pedestrian spatial and temporal violation behaviors.
