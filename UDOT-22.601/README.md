## MPC-693: Pedestrian safety and traffic operations near transit stops
This repository contains data and scripts associated with the "Pedestrian safety and traffic operations near transit stops" research project, funded by the Utah Department of Transportation as project UDOT-22.601 and by the Mountain-Plains Consoritum  as [project MPC-693](https://www.mountain-plains.org/research/details.php?id=590), and carried out by [Patrick Singleton](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/people/faculty/singleton-patrick), Aleks Paskett, [Fariba Soltani Mandolakani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariba-s-72717116a/), [Atul Subedi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atulsub/), [Michelle Mekker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-mekker-548804152/), and the [Singleton Transportation Lab](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/research/labs/patrick-singleton/index) at Utah State University.
* **Objective**
    * To investigate the impacts of transit stop location (near-side versus far-side) on pedestrian safety and traffic operations at intersections. 
* **Methods**
    * Three different video-based behavioral observation data collections at signals in Utah were utilized and studied:
        * Transit stop events (interactions between transit vehicles and other vehicles) and transit passenger crossing behaviors and vehicle conflicts;
        * Pedestrian conflicts with right-turning vehicles (conflict severity, driver/pedestrian reactions); and
        * Pedestrian crossing behaviors (crossing location, crossing behaviors).
    * These outcomes were then statistically compared for near-side versus far-side transit stop locations.
